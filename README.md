# The Countries UI

This is the frontend application for the countries APIs in https://github.com/bambiit/countries
The project has only two URLs. 

The index page lists all the relevant countries with a filter. The content is fetched from the Backend API, which is
 located at http://localhost:8081/api/countries.
 
Another page is /country/:name, which lists all the details of the specified country.

## Note

The page of restcountries.eu is broken at the moment this project is developed. Their resources of flag images are
 broken as well. Therefore, the images of flags that are displayed on the page might be broken as well.
